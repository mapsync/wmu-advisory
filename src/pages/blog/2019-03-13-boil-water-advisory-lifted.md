The Boil Water Advisory issued for the residents on E. Washington St., Jackson St., Jefferson St., Park Ave., Smith Ave. & Vine St. has been lifted and is no longer in effect.  The water has been tested and lab analyses have shown the water to be safe. Therefore, you will no longer need to boil any water.

Public safety, health, and water quality that meet the highest safety and health standards and guidelines are of the utmost importance to Winchester Municipal Utilities.

We appreciate your cooperation and apologize for any inconvenience this work may have caused.
