The Boil Water Advisory has been issued as a precautionary measure due to replacement of a damaged fire hydrant at the intersection of Jefferson St. & Jackson St. Customers in this area are advised to boil all water used for drinking and cooking for a minimum of three minutes before using.  The advisory will remain in effect until the situation has been corrected and test results have shown the water to be of an acceptable quality.
