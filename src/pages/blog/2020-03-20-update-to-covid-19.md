In the interest of public and employee health during this COVID-19 outbreak, effective Monday, March 23, 2020, Winchester Municipal Utilities (WMU) will be closing the front office lobby to walk-in customers. In the meantime, staff will still be on duty answering service calls and assisting you. We will continue to closely monitor the rapidly changing COVID-19 situation and will follow guidance from the CDC, state and local health authorities.  For more details go to the WMU [website](http://www.wmutilities.com/).
