**Fix a Leak Week** is March 18 thru 24, 2019.  According to the Environmental Protection Agency, household leaks account for more than 1 trillion gallons of water wasted each year in the U.S.  In addition to needlessly wasting this precious natural resource, leaks also cost money.  Timely repair of leaks and proper maintenance of home plumbing can save homeowners money on their water and sewer bill.  Here are some simple steps homeowners can take to check for leaks:  

* Check your water meter before and after a two-hour period when no water is being used. If the     meter does not read exactly the same, you may have a leak. 
* Check faucets for leaks by monitoring for drips of water under sinks and from exposed pipes. 
*  Check toilets for leaks by placing a few drops of food coloring in the toilet tank.  If the color shows up in the bowl within 15 minutes without flushing, you have a leak.  Flush immediately after this experiment to avoid staining the tank. 
* Monitor your water bill.  If water usage spikes without any obvious change to indoor and outdoor water use patterns, you may have a leak.

Common types of leaks found in the home include worn toilet flappers, dripping faucets and showerheads and other leaking valves.  All are relatively easy to correct.  The services of a plumber may be required for more complicated repairs.

Because minor water leaks account for more than 1 trillion gallons of water wasted each year in US homes, the US Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s Water Sense program promotes Fix a Leak Week the third week of March each year.  Fix a Leak Week is an annual reminder to Americans to check household plumbing fixtures and irrigations systems for leaks.
