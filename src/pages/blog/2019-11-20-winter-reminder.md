description: Help Prevent Your Water Pipes from Freezing!
---
Winter is fast approaching and WMU would like to remind our customers of some precautions that could avoid frozen and damaged water lines.  The cold from last winter caused a great deal of damage to both household plumbing and buried pipes.  We ask our customers to consider the following options:

* Disconnect and drain outside hoses.
* Turn off outside spigots and drain (if possible).
* Insulate and/or heat wrap (tape) water lines in unheated crawl spaces.
* When temperatures drop below freezing for long periods, open cabinet doors under sinks to expose water lines to room heat.
* When temperatures drop well below freezing, customers should consider allowing the cold water faucets to be open slightly to maintain some flow to keep the lines from freezing.
* If customer's water lines are directly against the basement or crawl space walls, consider moving the lines away from the wall even if only by a small distance.
* If your house has a crawl space located under it, close all air vents located in the foundation wall.  
* If you plan an extended vacation during cold weather, call WMU to have the water turned off at the meter.  Then, you may drain your water pipes; turn off the water heater and other water using devices, to give your pipes extra protection from freezing.  
* Keep the water meter box lid closed to prevent the meter from freezing.  Report broken or missing lids by calling Winchester Municipal Utilities weekdays from 7:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. at (859) 744-5434.  After business hours or on weekends, call (859) 744-6582.

WMU will continue to update this reminder with additional items when available.
