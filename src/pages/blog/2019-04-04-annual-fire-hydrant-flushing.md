In conjunction with the annual fire hydrant flushing program, WMU and the Clark County Fire Department will be flushing hydrants on Thursday, April 04, 2019. 

Customers in the immediate vicinity of the work may experience temporary discoloration of their water caused by sedimentation being broken loose from the water lines.  This discoloration does not affect the safety of the water and should be clear within 2-3 hours of the work being performed.  

It is advised that No Washing of Clothes or other water sensitive operations be performed until the water clears completely.  Additionally, it is also recommended that you limit or avoid using hot water and allow a cold water faucet to run a few minutes before using.  

We appreciate your cooperation and apologize for any inconvenience this work may cause.  Flushing for the day will occur in the following area(s):

* Colby Hills Drive
* Colby Hills Circle
