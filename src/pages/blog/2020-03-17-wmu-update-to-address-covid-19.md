In response to the developing events of the spread of the COVID-19 virus, Winchester Municipal Utilities (WMU) has temporarily suspended all water service shut-offs for non-payment and will begin reinstating service to customers who have been previously shut-off.  Utility customers should continue to pay their bill for the water, sewer, and solid waste charges as they will be ultimately responsible for any charges accrued during this moratorium.  We encourage those who can’t pay by their due date to contact WMU Customer Service to help with payment options.  In addition, WMU will be suspending all non-emergency service calls and appointments and will limit contact with customers during all emergency service calls.

At this time, the WMU utility billing office and drive-thru will remain open for in person payments, but we strongly encourage you to interact with us remotely, rather than in person, whenever possible.  To make your payment without visiting our office, the following resources are available:

* Call Customer Service at (859) 744-5434 during regular office hours - 7:00 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. (Monday - Friday)
* Mail in payments.  For your convenience an envelope is provided in your monthly billing statement.
* Call Customer Service and set up automatic bank draft.
* Leave a bill payment in our on-site drop box – 24 / 7
* Visit our website and make [online payments](https://smartbillcorp.com/oa/frmLogin.aspx?ws=winchesterky)
* Download the WMU Advisory App on your smartphone or tablet to connect to our [online payments](https://smartbillcorp.com/oa/frmLogin.aspx?ws=winchesterky).  Android users can go to Google Play and iPhone users can go to the Apple store to download the free app.  

It is also important for you to know that your drinking water remains safe.  At the WMU water treatment plant it isn’t necessary for us to use any special treatment practices to kill the novel coronavirus.  The methods that are already used, on a daily basis, are more than sufficient to kill the virus should it enter the water system.  WMU utilizes chlorine to disinfect the water from bacteria and viruses.  Viruses, such as COVID-19, are very susceptible to being treated with chlorine.  We chlorinate to a level that successfully addresses pathogens and bacteria found in surface water that are much more severe and resistant than the coronavirus.  

Should you have any questions or would like additional information, please contact Customer Service at (859) 744-5434.
