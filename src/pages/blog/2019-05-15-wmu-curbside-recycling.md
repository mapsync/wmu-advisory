Winchester Municipal Utilities (WMU) provides residential solid waste customers with curbside single-stream recycling in which all recyclables, including newspaper, cardboard, plastic, aluminum, junk mail, etc., are placed in a single bin for recycling.  The WMU recycling trucks collect the recyclables and transport them to the Lexington Recycle Center (or Lexington Materials Recovery Facility) to be sorted into various commodity streams for sale to markets, where it is processed into feedstock which can be used in the manufacture of new products.

On Tuesday, May 14, 2019, WMU Staff was notified by the Lexington Recycle Center that effective immediately they have temporarily suspended recycling of paper products which includes office paper, envelopes, phone books, calendars, folders, fliers, shredded paper, newspaper, magazines, cereal boxes, paper towel rolls and similar products.  

The WMU Transfer Station currently does not have a means of sorting the commingled mixture of recyclables into separate commodities (newspaper, paperboard, corrugated fiberboard, plastic, glass, metal, etc.).  Therefore, due to this recent change in policy by the Lexington Recycle Center to landfill any unclaimed paper and to avoid the increased processing fees associated with these materials, WMU curbside recycling will be suspended until further notice.  All curbside recyclable material that is collected will be sent to the landfill.  

WMU encourages customers to use the voluntary Recycling Center located at 175 N. Maple Street.  The recycling center is open 24 hours per day, 7 days per week and is located behind WMU's Main Office at 150 N. Main Street; however, it is only accessible from the WMU N. Maple Street entrance.  Plastic screw top bottles and jugs, glass bottles and jars, aluminum and steel cans and dry cardboard will still be recycled from this lot.  For more information, please contact the WMU Solid Waste Dept. at (859) 744-1170.
