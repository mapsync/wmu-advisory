description: Help eliminate grease
---
Residents can help prevent pipe blockages and sewer overflows by keeping Fats, Oils, and Grease (FOG) out of the sewer system.  When washed down the sink or toilet, FOG sticks to the inside of sewer pipes and builds up, causing sewer backups into homes, apartments, and businesses.  Sewer backups are costly to repair and present a significant public health risk.  Here are some simple steps residents can take to help prevent sewer backups:

NEVER:

* Never pour grease down sink drains 
* Never use the toilet to dispose of food grease or   scraps, sanitary items, baby wipes, diapers, or towels

ALWAYS:

* Always dispose of cooled cooking grease in a container with a lid and throw in the garbage. 
* Always scrape food scraps from dirty dishes and pans into the trash before washing.
* Always use a paper towel or a scraper to remove residual grease from dishes and pans prior to washing.
* Always use baskets or strainers in sinks to catch food scraps and empty the scraps into the trash. 
* Minimize the use of the garbage disposal - it does not eliminate grease, these units only shred solid material into smaller pieces and will not prevent grease from going down the drain.
